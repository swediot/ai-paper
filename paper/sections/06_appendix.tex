\caption{Share wanting fewer hours by birth cohort and language region. The Millennial panel begins in 2004 (the cohort midpoint, 1988, plus 16, i.e.\ the approximate year when the median Millennial entered the labor force). Note that around 2020, the Boomer cohort midpoint (1955) plus 65 equals 2020, so many Boomers were at or near statutory retirement age during the post-pandemic period; the late-period Boomer estimates should be interpreted with this compositional shift in mind.}\label{fig:app_cohort_trends}

\section{Robustness Checks}\label{app:robustness}



\subsection{Alternative Outcomes}

Table~\ref{tab:robust_alt} replaces the primary burnout outcomes with two additional measures: satisfaction with work conditions, and post-work exhaustion.
